Retrieving CVE ID information

This is a program to retrieve information of CVE IDs. These information includes:
    1. CVE ID
    2. EPSS
    3. Severity
    4. CVSS Score
    5. Vendor
    6. Product
    7. Affected Version
    8. References

Important files:
    1. CVE.xslx
    2. main.py
    3. readme.txt
    4. output.csv

Purpose of CVE.xslx
    - This file will contain the CVEs that will be searched.
    - Make sure to insert the list of CVEs only in the first column of the first sheet. This is important.
    - Also, ensure that:
        - That there are no trailing spaces for each CVE ID
        - Other columns are empty

Purpose of main.py
    - This is where the program file which will use to run the automation.
    - Once have insrted the list of CVEs in the CVE.xslx file, simply run this code
    - The output of the results will be inserted into a csv file called output.csv
    - To avoid confusion, ensure that the current directory is within the same folder where all the other files exist.
        - This is to ensure that output.csv will be created in the same directory

Purpose of output.csv
    - This will store the retrieved information of CVEs.
    - Note:
        - There will be cases where certain values cannot be found, therefore double checking manually from the website is needed.
